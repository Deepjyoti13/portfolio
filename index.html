                        Shaping myself in becoming a full stack developer.

                        I am a proud member of the Fine Arts Club of our college. All these days we guys were doing a great job in creating a colorful environment in our college but without any social recognition. So I along with my friend have decided to put our art works in our very own Fine Arts Club website. And we are currently devoting our time in building this website.

                        I was selected for an internship in Optum, the technical branch of the UnitedHealth Group. But owing to the catastrophic COVID-19 my industrial experience as an Optum intern never came to being. So I am utilising my quarantine period in learning new things. Django being one of them.

                        I have passed my Madhyamik exam from North Point School under Tripura Board of Secondary Education. I secured 614 marks out of 700 at 87.7%.

                        I was then admitted to Bhavan's Tripura VidyaMandir from where I graduated under Central Board of Secondary Education. I scored 452 marks out of 500 at 90.4%.

                        I then cracked JEE Mains and got into National Institute of Technology, Agartala. I took Computer Science and Education as my specialization stream.
